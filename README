ASSIGNMENT #4
NAME: Dan Borah

BUILDING/USAGE:
run `make` to build programs
./fs-find [partition.img path]
./fs-cat [partition.img path] [file path]

WHAT TO KNOW:
After going to office hours, I did some work on the assignment, hopefully implementing 
indirection. I have the basic architecture but am having trouble testing it. 
Specifically, I find fs-find to be tough to test. fs-cat seems to work as I can create
a file that is super large easily. Yet, I am having trouble with creating a ton of
directories to test find. I use bash and can use $(seq 1..30000) in a for loop to create
directories. But this takes forever and I always end up running out of space. When
I do a smaller number, I never reach the indirect blocks. Any advice would be 
appreciated.

Also, my fs-cat's parsing is pretty inflexible. Essentially, you cannot start of end 
with a '/' in the path name. I would be happy to change this is necessary. But the 
program works, (hopefully) fulfilling the conceptual goals of this assignment.
