ASSIGNMENT #4
NAME: Dan Borah

BUILDING/USAGE:
run `make` to build programs
./fs-find [partition.img path]
./fs-cat [partition.img path] [file path]

WHAT TO KNOW:
My programs can handle all the direct blocks. Where I am stuck is handling the 
indirect blocks. I understand that these blocks hold data block numbers for data
blocks or more indirect blocks. I just don't know what structure they look like
and how to parse these structures. Adivce on where to find information on this or
how to print these indirect data blocks out so I could see how they are set up 
would be much appreciated.

Also, my fs-cat's parsing is pretty inflexible. Essentially, you cannot start of end 
with a '/' in the path name. I would be happy to change this is necessary. But the 
program works, (hopefully) fulfilling the conceptual goals of this assignment.
