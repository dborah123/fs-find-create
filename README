ASSIGNMENT #4
NAME: Dan Borah

BUILDING/USAGE:
run `make` to build programs
./fs-find [partition.img path]
./fs-cat [partition.img path] [file path]

WHAT TO KNOW:
My programs can handle the all the direct blocks. Where I am stuck is handling the 
indirect blocks. I understand that these blocks hold data block numbers for data
essentially. I just don't know what structure they look like and how to parse these
structures. Adivce on where to find information on this or how to print these indirect
data blocks out would be much appreciated.
